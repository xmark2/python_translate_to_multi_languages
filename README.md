# python_translate_to_multi_languages
This app is using the google translator api. You have to type your text and after you get the output in json format.

Please note that the output can have unicode characters. If you want to convert use unicodedata.

Read more about unicode characters here:

Here is a short example that I found on stackoverflow:
